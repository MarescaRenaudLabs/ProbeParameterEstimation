# ProbeParameterEstimation

Code and data accompanying the paper: "Assessing Transducer Parameters for
accurate medium sound speed estimation and image reconstruction" 

Example data of internal lens reflections for the L12-3v, P4-1 and L6-24D can be
found in the data folder. 

The `findProbeParameters` function will search for the lens thickness, lens
speed of sound and time to peak of the waveform. 

Found parameters can be plotted using the `plotProbeParameters` function. 

There are several example scripts to show how to use the data for each
transducer.
